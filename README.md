The project uses a very simple structure:
- 2 packages to separate Data Structures classes and Algorithms classes
- A utils package with DisplayUtil class with a method to display a nice visual presentation for each algorithm used in the main class
- A main class for general purposes

The project was created using Intellij IDEA Ultimate as IDE, Maven as build tool and Oracle JDK 17.0.6.
